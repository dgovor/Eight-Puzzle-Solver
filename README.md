# Eight-Puzzle-Solver
AI model that solves an 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm.

## Description

The proposed algorithm was written in MATLAB as a possible solver for the 8-puzzle problem.
An 8-puzzle can be imagined as a 3-by-3 grid with 8 blocks located inside this grid (Illustrated in Figure 1). The blocks are numbered 1 through 8 with one empty space. To solve this puzzle one needs to reorder the blocks in a numerical order by moving blocks only with the empty space.
